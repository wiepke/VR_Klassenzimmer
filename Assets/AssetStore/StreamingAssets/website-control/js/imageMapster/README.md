###**ImageMapster:** A Jquery Plugin to make image maps useful. 

ImageMapster activates the areas in HTML imagemaps so you can highlight and select them. It has lots of other features for manual control, tooltips, resizing, and more. It is designed to be compatible with every common platform, and is tested with Internet Explorer 6-10, Firefox 3.0+, Safari, Opera, and Chrome. It works on mobile devices and doesn't use Flash.

### Release Information

<b>Questions?</b>

- I write about ImageMapster on my blog from time to time. See [posts about imagemapster.](http://blog.outsharked.com/search/label/imagemapster)

- Take a look at [ImageMapster questions on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=imagemapster); there are quite a few. Maybe someone's asked the same question already.

- There are also some very detailed discussions in the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/jamietre/imagemapster/issues?direction=desc&labels=support&page=1&sort=created&state=closed) section that I've flagged as "support". 

- You can also check the [feedback](http://www.outsharked.com/imagemapster/default.aspx?feedback.html) page on the project web site. 

- Still can't figure it out? [email me directly](mailto:alien@outsharked.com) if you still need help. I will respond as time permits, but I will always respond.


### Usage

----

Active all image maps on the page with default options: on mouseover areas are highlighted with a gray fill with no border, and clicking an area causes it to become selected.

    $('img').mapster();

Activate image maps with some specific options.

    $('img').mapster( { 
        fillColor: 'ff0000', 
        stroke: true, 
        singleSelect: true
    });


### Manual Control

----

There are lots of ways to manipulate the imagemap from Javascript. Here area a few; see the project web site for complete documentation.

**select**: Cause an area to become "selected"

    $('area').mapster('select');

Programatically select elements from the image map. The programmatic selection/deselection methods will not honor the staticState property.

**deselect**: Cause an area to become "selected"

    $('area').mapster('deselect');

**set**: select or deselect an element. If `selected` is true, the area is selected, if false, it is deselected.

    $('area').mapster('set',selected);

You can also select or deselect areas using a their `mapKey`. This is an attribute on each area in your HTML that identifies it. You define a mapKey using a configuration option: `mapKey: 'data-key'`.

    $('img').mapster('set',true,'key1,key2');

If two areas share the same value for the `mapKey` they will be automatically grouped together when activated. You can also use the values of the mapKey to select areas from code.

You can pass options to change the rendering effects when using set as the last parameter:

    $('img').mapster('set',true,'key', {fillColor: 'ff0000'} );

MapKeys can contain more than one value. The first value always defines groups when you mouse over. Other values can be used to create logical groups. For example:

    <img id="usamap" src="map.jpeg" usemap="#usa">
    <map name="usa">
		<area data-key="maine,new-england,really-cold" shape="poly" coords="...">
		<area data-key="new-hampshire,new-england,really-cold" shape="poly" coords="...">
		<area data-key="vermont,new-england,really-cold" shape="poly" coords="...">
		<area data-key="connecticut,new-england" shape="poly" coords="...">
		<area data-key="rhode-island,new-england" shape="poly" coords="...">
		<area data-key="massachusetts,new-england" shape="poly" coords="...">
		<!-- more states... -->
    </map>

    $('#usamap').mapster( { mapKey: 'data-key' } );

Mousing over each state would cause just that state to be higlighted. You can also select other logical groups from code code:

    // select all New England states
    $('img').mapster('set',true,'new-england');

    // select just Maine, New Hampshire & Vermont
    $('img').mapster('set',true,'really-cold');

Groups created this way are *independent* of the primary group. If you select "new-england" from code, you can't unselect just "MA" by clicking on it. You would have to unselect "new-england" from code. 

To simply indentify a set of areas to turn on or off, but not treat them as a logical group, you can use CSS classes and select areas directly, or use the <code>keys</code> option to identify the primary keys associated with a group (see documentation).

### Zepto Compatibility

Newer versions of Zepto don't seem to work any more (as of 1.2.5). I didn't want this to hold up the ever-delayed release even further so I didn't figure out why. 

In theory it should work; you need to use the "jquery.imagemapster.zepto.js" build. This patches a few holes in Zepto that ImageMapster needs. It is safe to use the zepto version with jQuery.

### Build instructions

The source code is broken into several modules to make management easier and to make it possible to create feature-targeted builds. A rakefile is included that creates and minifies the two release builds (with and without Zepto support):

`rake`
